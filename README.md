# ðŸ§  Smart Issue Tracker ðŸ’¡

A modern issue tracking system powered by AI that automatically classifies, prioritizes, and enriches tickets.

## Overview

This project provides an intelligent issue tracking system that uses AI to streamline the ticket management process. Users enter a simple free-text description of a problem, and the system automatically:

- Classifies the issue (bug, feature, support, etc.)
- Infers priority, affected product area, and best-fit team
- Enriches the ticket with a concise summary and suggested next steps

## Architecture

The application uses a microservices architecture:

- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript, Redux, TailwindCSS
- Backend: Java 21 + Spring Boot microservices
- APIs: REST, gRPC, GraphQL
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- Messaging: Apache Kafka
- AI: OpenAI/Gemini API
- Storage: AWS S3
- Deployment: Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
